Therefore, much unlike many other forms of intellectual property protection (most notably, patents), a PVR may be granted to the person who discovers a naturally occurring plant. The grant of a PVR does not prevent others from producing the protected variety for a noncommercial purpose, from using the plant for human consumption or another non-reproductive purpose, or from using the variety for planting breeding. Although others may use the protected variety for breeding purposes, a person who is not the owner may not use the protected variety for continued production of first-generation hybrid seed over a long period of time; thus effectively limiting the potential for a non-owner to derive any economic benefit. The protection afforded by the PVRA extends for a period of twenty years from the granting of protection for non-woody plants and twenty-three years for woody plants', '\xa0If New Zealand wishes to compete in a global market while refusing to implement UPOV 91, it must look to other ways to encourage PVR owners to invest their resources in New Zealand and thus reap the benefit of those varieties.', 'They are packed in plastic pottles which contain approx. 40 plants each.', 'Open pottle lids at least one hour before removing the plants from the pottle.
