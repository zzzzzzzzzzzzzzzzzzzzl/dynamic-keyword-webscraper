They like their roots to be tightly bound within the pot. In the summer Orchid plants will need to be sheltered from wind and rain and direct sunlight between late morning and mid afternoon. On extra hot days your cymbidiums will benefit from mistings. Expose your orchids to as much light as possible from late autumn through to winter to help the plants mature and harden. In winter its best to water early on fine sunny days so the plants can dry off before nightfall. Once your plants have finished flowering they can can be placed under a sheltered hedge until they spike again if not in a greenhouse. Finally remember to water your orchids and apply fertiliser and they will reward you well. NOTE: we only sell orchid plants from our nursery only - no courier service available.",
