--1 create script.
This will include setting up api keys for chat gpt.
I've created a program flowchart which will show how the script will function

--2 testing scripts and prompts.
make sure the scripts are all working as intended, and check the our prompts for the api are working how we want them to
and not returning false positives

--3 optimization.
This will mostly involve setting up threading for our script so that we can look at pages or websites at once.
we greatly increase the speed of our script with this.

--4 set up digital ocean vm.
set up a python environment for vm, and add all of the relevant scripts and files.
